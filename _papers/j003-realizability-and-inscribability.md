We show that nonlinear optimization techniques can successfully be applied to realize and to inscribe matroid polytopes and simplicial spheres. Thus we obtain a complete classification of neighborly polytopes of dimension 4, 6 and 7 with 11 vertices, of neighborly 5-polytopes with 10 vertices, as well as a complete classification of simplicial 3-spheres with 10 vertices into polytopal and non-polytopal spheres. Surprisingly many of the realizable polytopes are also inscribable.
